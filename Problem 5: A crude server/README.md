# A crude server

## About the stack

For this question, as I have no experience with Typescript, I will implement this using normal JavaScript. I think instead of investigating time learning more about TypeScript and maybe makes some silly mistakes, It is much better to investigate the same amount of time on figure out the optimal architecture for question 6, so that I can show the best out of my ability and you can also have a deeper insight into my ability as well.

I decide to choose sqlite3 as the database to make application persistent.

## Set up

```bash
  npm install
